# Jersey City 2018 Reval Proposed Assessments

Jersey City is undergoing its first complete property reval since 1988. Appraisal Systems has been putting the assessment information online but as PDFs, which are not very accessible or parseable. This repo is an effort to present the data in a more web-friendly and universally searchable format, as well as possibly using the data for further analysis and visualizations.

Some ideas I have include:

* Loading data into a web table view more dynamically (the current setup probably won't scale much further).
* Heatmaps of percentage change in assessed value and estimated taxes.
* Breakdowns by neighborhood and ward.

## What does this even mean?

Well, in short, people's property values are changing, both in absolute terms and relative to other properties in Jersey City, which changes their tax burden. Brigid D'Souza over at Civic Parent has [a great set of resources](https://civicparent.org/jerseycity-revaluation-lets-getcivic/).

## Why do you care?

I own a home in Ward A. :)
